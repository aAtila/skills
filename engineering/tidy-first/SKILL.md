# Tidy First

> **Make the change easy, then make the easy change.** — Kent Beck

Prepare the landing zone for a single imminent change, then make the change. The structural prep and the behavioral change are **two separate acts, two separate commits** — never one tangle.

Per issue, as the **zero step of implementation**:

```
pick issue → context_builder (blast radius + direction) → tidy-first → tdd (red → green → refactor)
```

## The two gates (this is the whole skill)

A candidate tidying may only be done if it passes **both**:

1. **Change-scope gate** — tidy *only what makes THIS change easier*. Not about to touch that code for this issue? You don't tidy it, no matter how messy — paying now for an option on an uncertain future change rarely covers its cost. A tidy with no behavioral change waiting behind it is a **sweep**.
2. **Direction gate** — tidy *only what is stable across your chosen approach*. If approach A and approach B would tidy different things, your direction isn't locked — resolve the fork (`grill-me` or a spike) first.

A candidate that fails either gate is **dropped** — but make the decision *explicit*: file it now if it's actionable and worth tracking (route to `improve-*` or the tracker), or consciously let it go. Never leave it as invisible "later" — that's how a codebase accrues chronic under-tidying.

## Tidy on green only

- **Suite red?** Get it green first. On a failing suite you can't tell a behavior-preserving move from a behavior-changing one — the one thing this skill keeps separate.
- **No tests on the blast radius?** Then "green" is meaningless. Write a characterization test to pin current behavior, or limit yourself to mechanical, tool-verified moves (IDE rename/extract) that preserve behavior by construction.

## Process

**0. Restate the change in one sentence.** *"I am about to change X so that Y."* This is the target both gates bite on. Can't write it? That's a `context_builder` / `grill-me` problem, not a tidying one.

**1. Curate the blast radius with `context_builder`** in **clarify** mode (or a directional `question`) — surface the files, functions, and seams this lands on, plus enough direction to judge the direction gate. **Not `plan` mode**: a line-level plan built against messy code bakes in the hard version of the change and defeats the skill. Directional thinking belongs here; the detailed steps emerge later, from the now-easier code. Fall back to `file_search` + `read_file` only when `context_builder` is unavailable or the change lands in one function you can already see whole.

**2. Find candidate tidyings inside the blast radius** — small, behavior-preserving legibility moves only. Run each through both gates; keep the survivors. Done when **every file in the blast radius has been read against this catalog** — not when you have "some" candidates.

   - **Guard clauses** — flatten nested conditionals into early returns
   - **Dead code** — delete unreached branches, unused params, stale flags
   - **Normalize symmetry** — make things that do the same thing look the same
   - **Reading order** — reorder so it reads as a reader needs; put things that change together next to each other
   - **Extract helper** — pull a confusing chunk into a named function
   - **Explaining variable / constant** — name a magic value or dense subexpression
   - **Rename** — give a vague name the domain word for what it does
   - **Chunk statements** — blank-line a long run into labelled paragraphs
   - **Delete redundant comments** — when a rename or extract made them noise

**3. Present the shortlist — and stop.** Each item gets one line: *why it makes THIS change easier* (not "cleaner"). Can't articulate that link? It fails the change-scope gate. Fifteen candidates is a sweep. **This shortlist is the skill's primary output. Do not edit yet.**

**4. Apply now, or hand off — the user's call.**
   - **Execute now.** Behavior must not change: same inputs, outputs, side effects. Run the existing tests/checks after tidying to confirm, then commit the tidy **in its own commit, separate from the behavioral change** — so a reviewer can read structure and behavior independently and revert either alone (squashing at the PR boundary is fine; the discipline is in how you author it, not the merge artifact). Continue to step 5.
   - **Hand off.** Don't touch code. Use `handoff` to capture the one-sentence change, the curated blast radius, and the approved shortlist (each item with its rationale, plus the execute discipline above) for a fresh session to execute. The skill ends here.

**5. Hand off to `tdd`** (only if you executed). Say: *"Structural prep committed separately — the change is now easy. Starting TDD."* Then make the easy change through red → green → refactor.

## Worked examples

Scenario throughout: *"I am about to add a `priorityFee` to the checkout total."*

- **Passes both gates.** `calculateTotal()` interleaves subtotal/tax/discount math over 40 lines; your change adds one term. Extract `applyDiscounts(subtotal)` so the slot for `priorityFee` becomes obvious and isolated. Easier *and* stable across approaches. **Do it.**
- **Fails change-scope.** `formatReceipt()` has the same interleaving — but your change never touches it. No behavioral change behind it. **Drop; file an issue only if genuinely worth it.**
- **Fails scope, wrong skill.** The real friction is pricing spread across three modules that "should" be one `Pricing` service. True, but that's a risky depth refactor. **File it, route to `improve-codebase-architecture`. Don't smuggle it in.**

## Boundaries

- **`improve-codebase-architecture` / `improve-codebase-colocation`** — codebase-wide depth/placement sweeps; tidy-first is bound to one imminent change.
- **`aa-commit-clarity`** — splits code you *already* mixed (reactive); tidy-first sequences the work so structure and behavior are never mixed to begin with (proactive).
- **`tdd`'s post-green refactor** — that's tidy-*after*. tidy-first tidies *before* the first red; the two bookend the loop.
